# Scrimba Unit Converter

Imperial to metric units AND metric to imperial units converter for weight, length and volume.

Based on the JavaScript Scrimba lesson pressented [here](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/solo-project-unit-converter-cz9aPNSr).

Design based on the [Figma file provided](https://www.figma.com/file/cqtGul0V8RFXY4vTcIv1Kc/Unit-Conversion?node-id=0%3A1).

I have modified the dark-themed design with a different colour palette, as seen in this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/rgdvaagCpTtqDE6888SsDh/Unit-Conversion-(Copy)).
